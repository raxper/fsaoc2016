    <description>FsCheck is a tool for testing .NET programs automatically. The programmer provides
a specification of the program, in the form of properties which functions, methods
or objects should satisfy, and FsCheck then tests that the properties hold in a
large number of randomly generated cases.
    
While writing the properties, you are actually writing a testable specification of your program.
    
Specifications are expressed in F#, C# or VB, using combinators defined
in the FsCheck library. FsCheck provides combinators to define properties,
observe the distribution of test data, and define test data generators.
When a property fails, FsCheck automatically displays a minimal counter example.</description>
    <summary>FsCheck is a tool for testing .NET programs automatically using randomly generated test cases.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>Switch FsCheck.NUnit to use NUnit 3. This solves a lot of issues with NUnit 2's wonky plugin model.
FsCheck.NUnit.Addin is no longer needed, for example, and neither is the install.ps1 in the FsCheck.NUnit package. Also,
FsCheck.NUnit only needs a dependency on NUnit now, which should solve a bunch of install issues on its own.
(like xUnit 2 support, another heroic contribution by Jon Hamm, and brilliantly pushed over the finish line by Mark Lambert.)
NUnit versions &amp;lt; 3.0 are no longer supported. The latest FsCheck version that supports NUnit 2.6.4 is FsCheck.NUnit 2.6.3.</releaseNotes>
